TODO:
- **Add options to remove timestamps and/or comment overlays with an n amount of timestamps to root out all certain comments that list out chapters, this moment, etc... which could clog up visual space and be unnecessary.**
- Somehow make last shown timestamp' glow (when a comment overlay has multiple timestamps)
- **Add Read more button for long timestamps and comment overlays.**
- **Add n indicator to prevent the same comment overlay being duplicated.**
- **Somehow make a way for long comment overlays wait a bit more before disappearing, or let user manually "swipe" to hide them...**
- **Add option to change comment overlay position from top left to other directions.**
- **When in full screen and scrolling through a timestamp (the second screenshot for example), add-on should still scroll that timestamp instead of YouTube's more videos.**
- Add a button next to video controls to quickly show/hide comment overlays.
- Make comment overlay change size when video is in normal/full screen/miniplayer.
- Show other data like display name and options to show/hide them the options menu. Maybe?
- Keyboard shortcuts to navigate between each timestamps and comment overlays within them?
